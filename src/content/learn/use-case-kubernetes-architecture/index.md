How our solutions help organizations implement a robust zero trust security model using Istio and Envoy in Kubernetes environments, particularly on platforms like [AWS](/blog/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-istio-a-comprehensive-guide/) and Azure. Here’s how Tetrate’s offerings address key aspects of microservices architecture, observability, and security:

## Use Cases

*   **Large-Scale Microservices Management:** eBay’s use case demonstrates how Istio can be used to manage traffic in a complex, multi-datacenter environment with multiple Kubernetes clusters. This showcases Istio’s ability to handle large-scale microservices architectures.
*   **Zero Trust Security Implementation:** Tetrate provides a consistent way to implement Zero Trust security across thousands of microservices in various environments. This is particularly crucial for organizations dealing with sensitive data or those under regulatory compliance like PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, and [FIPS/FedRAMP](/learn/fips/fips-fedramp/).
*   **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Deployments:** Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB) enables management of services across multiple clusters, clouds, and hybrid environments. This is valuable for organizations operating in complex, distributed infrastructures.
*   **Traffic Management and Routing:** Tetrate’s service mesh provides advanced traffic management capabilities, including traffic routing, splitting, and canary deployments. This is useful for organizations looking to implement sophisticated deployment strategies.
*   **Observability and Troubleshooting:** The service mesh offers improved visibility into service health and performance, making it easier to troubleshoot application issues and investigate security incidents.
*   **Kubernetes and VM Integration:** Tetrate has extended Istio’s capabilities to integrate with legacy platforms, allowing organizations to manage both modern Kubernetes microservices and traditional VM applications under a single service mesh.
*   **Compliance and Policy Enforcement:** Tetrate automates the deployment of security policies and enables continuous compliance monitoring, which is particularly valuable for highly regulated industries.
*   **Military and Defense Applications:** The U.S. Air Force has contracted Tetrate for implementing Istio-based resilient communications and enhancing DevSecOps security. This demonstrates the platform’s applicability in high-security, mission-critical environments.
*   **Ambient Mode for Resource Optimization:** Tetrate is implementing ambient mode for the U.S. Air Force, allowing for more efficient resource utilization based on security risk profiles.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Tetrate Service Bridge supports multiple cloud platforms like Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and Red Hat OpenShift, making it versatile for organizations with diverse infrastructure.

## Architecture

Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB) provides a comprehensive [service mesh](/blog/service-mesh-architecture/) solution that seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, offering:

*   **Unified Control Plane:** TSB extends Istio’s capabilities, providing a single pane of glass for managing multiple clusters across different cloud providers and on-premises environments.
*   **Enhanced Proxy Model in sidecar or ambient mode:** We optimize Envoy’s sidecar proxy implementation, ensuring efficient and secure service-to-service communication.
*   **Multi-Cloud Support:** TSB enables consistent policies and management across AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and other Kubernetes platforms, simplifying multi-cloud deployments.

## Observability

Tetrate’s solutions significantly enhance observability in microservices environments:

*   **Advanced Metrics Collection:** TSBprovides native dashboards for in-depth performance analysis and integrates with popular tools like Prometheus.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** We offer seamless tracing, providing end-to-end visibility of request flows.
*   **Centralized Logging:** TSB aggregates and analyzes logs from across your service mesh, enabling quick troubleshooting and pattern recognition.
*   **Visualization:** TSB offers native network visualization and real-time metrics insights.

## Security

Tetrate puts a strong emphasis on zero trust security:

*   **Zero Trust Implementation:** TSB provides out-of-the-box zero trust security, aligning with CISA and NIST recommendations.
*   **Automated mTLS:** We ensure all service-to-service communication is encrypted and authenticated, with automatic certificate management.
*   **Fine-grained Access Control:** TSB enables detailed RBAC and ABAC policies, allowing precise control over service interactions.
*   **Identity Management:** We support integration with external identity providers and implement strong service identity verification.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** TSB integrates with Open Policy Agent (OPA) for advanced authorization policies.

## Advanced Load Balancing

Tetrate’s approach to [load balancing](/learn/kubernetes/kubernetes-ingress-load-balancer/) goes beyond basic Kubernetes capabilities:

*   **Global Load Balancing:** Tier-1 gateways enable global load balancing across multiple clusters, allowing for traffic distribution based on weighted percentages.
*   **Cross-Cluster Load Balancing:** TSB facilitates load balancing across different Kubernetes clusters, supporting multi-cluster and multi-cloud deployments.
*   **L7 Load Balancing:** TSB implements Layer 7 load balancing across one or more ingress gateways in different clusters over Istio-controlled mTLS

## Cloud Provider Integration

Tetrate’s solutions are designed to work seamlessly with major cloud providers:

*   **AWS Integration:** TSB integrates with AWS services like ACM for certificate management and supports deployment on EKS.
*   **Azure Support:** We provide full support for Azure AKS, enabling seamless service mesh implementation in Azure environments.
*   **Multi-Cloud Management:** TSB offers a consistent management layer across different cloud providers, simplifying hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.

## Enterprise-Ready Features

Tetrate Service Bridge goes beyond open-source Istio to provide enterprise-grade features:

*   **Simplified Configuration:** TSB offers an intuitive interface for managing complex service mesh configurations across multiple clusters.
*   **Scalability:** Our solution is built to handle enterprise-scale deployments, managing thousands of services efficiently.
*   **Compliance and Governance:** TSB helps enforce organizational policies and compliance requirements across the entire service mesh.
*   **Expert Support:** We provide enterprise-grade support and professional services to ensure successful implementation and operation of your service mesh.
