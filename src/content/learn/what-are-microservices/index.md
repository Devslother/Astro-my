# What Are Microservices?

### Article content

## Overview

Microservices are a software architecture approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that work together to provide functionality. Each microservice typically performs a single function or task and communicates with other microservices through lightweight protocols, such as RESTful APIs. This allows developers to work on different parts of the application without affecting other services, making it easier to maintain and update the system. The decomposition of functionality into smaller units also makes it easier to scale them independently, which makes the system more resilient to changes in traffic or demand over time.

## Benefits of Microservices

Some of the key advantages of a [microservices architecture include](/learn/what-are-microservices/):

### Scalability

Microservices make it easier to scale applications as needed, by allowing developers to add or remove services as necessary.

### Agility 

Microservices enable faster development and deployment of new features, as each service can be developed and tested independently.

### Resilience 

Microservices architecture can help ensure that applications remain resilient in the face of failures, as services can be designed to fail independently of one another.

### Maintainability

By breaking applications down into smaller, more manageable services, it becomes easier to maintain and update them over time.

## Challenges of a Microservices Architecture

These are some of the key challenges that need to be addressed when developing and deploying microservices applications:

### Complexity

Microservices architecture can be highly complex, with numerous services communicating with each other. It is important to have effective management tools and strategies in place to ensure that the entire system remains manageable and maintainable.

### Observability

As highly distributed systems, it can be challenging to understand all of the interactions between services and to identify issues as they arise. It is important to have a suite of observability tools that allow you to monitor and track the performance of individual services and the system as a whole. This can help you identify and troubleshoot issues more quickly and effectively.

### Service Discovery

Service discovery enables services to locate and communicate with each other in a scalable and efficient manner. A robust service discovery mechanism is essential for ensuring the reliable operation of the entire system.

### Security 

As many services communicate with each other over networks, it is important to have a comprehensive security strategy that protects sensitive data and ensures that only authorized services can access each other.

### Deployment

An efficient automated deployment pipeline is key to enjoying the agility benefits of microservices applications. Having automation and continuous deployment in place will help ensure that updates are deployed quickly, efficiently and reliably.

### Configuration Management

Managing configurations across multiple services can be challenging. It is important to have effective configuration management tools and strategies in place to ensure that the entire system is configured properly and consistently.

### Dependency Management

With multiple services interacting with each other, it is important to manage dependencies effectively to ensure that changes to one service do not impact the entire system. It is important to have effective dependency management tools and strategies in place to minimize the risk of such issues.

### Resilience and Fault Tolerance

For applications with multiple dynamically deployed instances and many services, having mechanisms in place to ensure that the system remains available and responsive in the face of service failures or other issues is important. This can involve implementing resilience and fault tolerance mechanisms, such as circuit breaking and retries.

## When Should You Use Microservices?

Microservices architecture can be a good fit for large, complex applications that require high scalability, flexibility and agility. Here are some scenarios where microservices architecture may be appropriate.

### Large, Complex Applications

Microservices architecture is ideal for large, complex applications that require high scalability and agility. This approach can help you break down the application into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to develop, test and deploy.

### Rapid Iteration

Microservices architecture can help you develop and deploy new features more quickly and with less risk. Since each service is developed and deployed independently, it is easier to test and deploy new features without affecting the entire application.

### High Traffic And Peak Loads

If your application experiences high traffic and peak loads, microservices architecture can help you scale individual components independently. This can help ensure that your application remains responsive and available even during high traffic periods.

### Multiple Development Teams

Microservices architecture can help you divide the application into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier for multiple development teams to work on different services simultaneously. This can help speed up development times and reduce time-to-market.

### Polyglot Development

Microservices architecture allows you to use different programming languages and technologies for different services. This can be useful if you have a diverse development team with different skill sets and preferences.

Microservices architecture can be a good fit for applications that require high scalability, agility and flexibility. However, it is important to carefully consider the complexity and potential challenges of this approach before adopting it.

## Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

Microservices and monolithic architectures are two different software development approaches that have their own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some key differences between the two:

### Architecture

In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In contrast, microservices applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other.

### Development

Development of monolithic applications can be slower and more cumbersome, as any changes made to the application require the entire application to be rebuilt and redeployed. On the other hand, microservices development can be faster and more agile, as developers can work on different services simultaneously.

### Deployment

Monolithic applications are deployed as a single unit. This can make it challenging to deploy new features or updates without affecting the entire system. With microservices, each service can be deployed independently, which makes it easier to test and deploy new features without affecting the entire application.

### Maintenance

Maintenance and updates to monoliths can be more challenging, as any changes made to the application can affect the entire system. In contrast, maintenance and updates of microservices can be easier to manage, as each service can be updated independently without affecting the entire application.

### Scalability

Scaling a monolithic application requires scaling the entire system. In contrast, with microservices, each service can be scaled independently, which means that you can allocate resources where they are needed most.

Microservices architecture can offer some advantages over monolithic architecture, including increased scalability, flexibility and faster development times. However, it also presents some unique challenges, including increased complexity. It’s important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches before choosing the one that is right for your application.

## Role of Service Mesh in Microservices Applications

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles communication between microservices. The service mesh provides a number of important functions, including:

### Traffic Management

A service mesh can handle traffic routing, load balancing and service discovery between services within the application. This can help ensure that traffic is directed to the appropriate service and can help improve application performance and reliability.

### Service Discovery

Microservices scalability and high availability is typically accomplished by dynamically scaling up the number of service instances in response to increased load or service outage and scaling back down when needed to save costs. A service mesh keeps track of all available service instances, automatically routing requests to them. When service instances become unavailable due to down-scaling, maintenance, or failure, service discovery removes them from the list of available instances and the mesh routes new requests to remaining available instances.

### Security

A service mesh can provide security features such as service authentication, encryption and access control. This can help ensure that sensitive data is protected and that only authorized services can communicate with each other.

### Observability 

A service mesh can provide monitoring and logging capabilities that allow you to track the health and performance of individual services within the application. This can help you identify and troubleshoot issues more quickly and effectively.

### Resilience

A service mesh can provide features such as circuit breaking and retries that can help ensure that the application remains available and responsive even during periods of high traffic or service failures.
