Kubernetes is the go-to choice for deploying containerized applications, but managing traffic within and between services is crucial for optimal performance. Kubernetes traffic routing encompasses how requests move between different services, ensuring that applications respond reliably and efficiently. Key mechanisms include **Services**, **Ingress Controllers**, and **Service Meshes**. Each provides unique ways to control and direct internal and external traffic, maintaining scalability and stability.

The core component of Kubernetes traffic management is the **Kubernetes Service**. It creates a stable endpoint to direct network traffic to pods. In more complex environments, **Ingress** and **Service Meshes** like Istio add layers of control. Ingress manages external access, while service meshes offer more sophisticated routing features, like retries, failover, and load balancing. It is important to note that Kubernetes Ingress gateways can use Kubernetes’ Ingress resource and Ingress controllers, but this approach is no longer recommended. Instead, using the **Kubernetes Gateway API** with **Gateway** resources is now the preferred method. Effective routing strategies ensure reduced latency, improved scalability, and a better overall user experience.

## Kubernetes Ingress and Egress Networking: Architecture Simplified

Kubernetes clusters must handle both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic to communicate effectively with the outside world. **Ingress** in Kubernetes is managed using **Ingress Controllers**, which map external HTTP/HTTPS requests to internal services. These controllers are essential for directing user traffic from outside the cluster, often used for load balancing and exposing services. It is now recommended to use the **Kubernetes Gateway API** and **Gateway** resources instead of traditional Ingress resources for better control and scalability. Choosing the right Ingress Controller, whether it’s NGINX, Traefik, or Envoy Gateway, can significantly impact traffic flow and scalability.

**Egress** handles outbound communication from pods to external resources, like APIs or databases. Configuring **Network Policies** and Egress Gateways is key for security and performance when accessing external networks. Egress also depends on controllers deployed in Kubernetes to manage outbound traffic. These components ensure that only authorized services can communicate outside of the cluster, adding an additional layer of control to the architecture.

If you need to [implement both Ingress and Egress gateway control](/learn/ingress-and-egress-architecture), it is recommended to use **Istio**. Istio provides a comprehensive solution for managing both incoming and outgoing traffic, with enhanced features for security, observability, and traffic control.

Together, Ingress and Egress form a comprehensive architecture that secures and optimizes the way Kubernetes clusters interact with both internal and external environments. Proper planning of ingress and egress strategies will improve reliability, security, and the efficiency of your Kubernetes applications.
