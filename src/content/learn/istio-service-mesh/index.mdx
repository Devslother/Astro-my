[Istio](https://academy.tetrate.io/courses/istio-fundamentals) is an open-source [service mesh platform](/what-is-istio-service-mesh/) that is designed to help developers manage and secure microservices-based applications. It provides a unified way to connect, monitor, and secure microservices across multiple clusters, platforms, and deployment models. Istio abstracts away the complexity of networking and security, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying their applications without worrying about infrastructure-related concerns. It also includes features like traffic management, load balancing, and fault tolerance, which can help improve the reliability and performance of microservices-based applications.
