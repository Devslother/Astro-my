Kubernetes is a favored solution among developers and DevSecOps teams due to its wide range of features, container management tools, and support by on-premises infrastructure suppliers and cloud service providers. The main reason for its popularity is that Kubernetes has revolutionized modern application deployment. It has transformed how organizations deploy, scale, and manage their applications.

## [](#benefits-of-kubernetes)Benefits of Kubernetes

Using Kubernetes to manage your containerization infrastructure offers numerous benefits. It improves scalability, portability, resource efficiency and more. It is an invaluable tool for modern application deployment and management. Some of the key advantages of using Kubernetes include:

## [](#common-use-cases-for-kubernetes)Common Use Cases for Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a versatile tool that IT teams can use for many deployment scenarios. Its primary strength lies in its ability to manage complex, distributed applications through automation, making it an ideal solution for many scenarios. Here are some common real-world use cases where Kubernetes excels:

*   Microservices architecture deployments
*   Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows
*   DevSecOps and agile development
*   Cloud-native application deployments
*   Supporting [multi-cloud](/resource/simplify-kubernetes-and-multi-cloud-complexity-with-the-service-mesh/) and hybrid cloud strategies
*   Big data and machine learning projects
*   Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing infrastructure management

Adopting Kubernetes as the platform for deploying, managing, and decommissioning your application containers will significantly reduce the management overhead for your infrastructure.
