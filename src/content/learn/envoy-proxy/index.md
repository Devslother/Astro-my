  Envoy is a high-performance, open-source proxy server designed for
  cloud-native applications. It is often used in conjunction with service mesh
  platforms like Istio to provide advanced traffic management, load balancing,
  and observability capabilities for microservices-based applications.
  Envoy(/what-is-envoy-proxy/) is built with a modular architecture that allows
