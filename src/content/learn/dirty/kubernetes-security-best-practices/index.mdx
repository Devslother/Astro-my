Kubernetes Security Best Practices

# Kubernetes Security Best Practices

Kubernetes has become a core component of modern application deployment by delivering flexibility, scalability, and efficiency for managing containerized applications. This article delves into [Kubernetes security](/faq/what-is-kubernetes-security/) best practices to guide technical decision-makers in fortifying their Kubernetes infrastructure against potential cybersecurity threats. 

We assume that readers know what Kubernetes is, the specialized language used to define components (clusters, pods, etc.), and typical use cases. We’ll proceed directly to discuss various Kubernetes security best practices and end with a short call to action pointing to [Tetrate’s Kubernetes management solutions](/kubernetes-consulting-services/) and how adding them to your toolkit can simplify and enhance the [security and management of Kubernetes environments](/learn/kubernetes-security-architecture/).

## Kubernetes Network Security

Using Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications and services in containers doesn’t change the need to provide robust cybersecurity protections. It is still essential to secure the networking used within a Kubernetes cluster.

A core step in delivering Kubernetes network security is defining and implementing network policies to control how pods communicate with each other and the wider network infrastructure beyond the Kubernetes environment. Another crucial step is the isolation of sensitive workloads using network segmentation techniques (discussed further in a section below). 

Network security best practices for Kubernetes deployments occur at multiple levels and via various techniques such as:

**The API Server**. The central management interface for a Kubernetes deployment. It is critical to protect it against unauthorized access.

**Authentication and Authorization Controls**. Implement [robust access control](/blog/rbac-vs-abac-vs-ngac/) to provide granular access control for managing user and service account permissions.

**Network Security Settings**. Use network policies and segmentation to control traffic flow, isolate sensitive workloads, and limit the potential attack surface available to cyber attackers.

**Strong Secrets Management**. Use Kubernetes Secrets or third-party secret stores to enable the secure storage and use of sensitive security access data such as passwords and API keys.

**Pod Security Policies**. Deploy well-tested Pod security policies to enforce security settings within the container environments to ensure secure configurations get deployed and limit potential attack vectors.

**Image Security**. Regularly scan container deployment images for known vulnerabilities and ensure that security patches for all components that comprise a container package get updated with the latest security updates.

## Kubernetes Microsegmentation

Microsegmentation in Kubernetes divides clusters into smaller, more manageable segments, each with specific security policies. This approach limits the potential impact of a breach, as attackers can only access a small portion of the network if they compromise a segment. Microsegmentation is core to delivering zero-trust networking best practices within a Kubernetes deployment.

In Kubernetes, microsegmentation is achieved using various techniques such as the namespaces outlined in the previous section, network policies to restrict traffic flows plus user/service access to Pods, and also via functionality provided by service meshes, such as encryption and traffic monitoring.

## Kubernetes PCI Compliance

Any organization handling credit card cardholder data is required to comply with the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) regulations](/resource/meeting-pci-compliance-standards/). You don’t need to operate at the consumer or retail border and collect payments directly from customers to be required to implement PCI requirements. If you handle or store cardholder data, you must be PCI compliant.

The inherent security built into Kubernetes management containerized financial application deployments can help reduce the burden of achieving PCI compliance. Features such as implementing strict access controls, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and maintaining a [secure network architecture](/learn/kubernetes-security-architecture/) directly map to PCI requirements. Kubernetes helps deliver PCI compliance through these built-in security features you will already use for basic security. It also allows you to easily integrate your deployed container-based financial applications with additional third-party security tools. 

Some PCI requirements that Kubernetes addresses as a core part of the platform are access control, microsegmentation, encrypting data at rest and in transit, logging and monitoring of traffic, plus vulnerability scanning and patching of deployed images and deployed containers.

## Enhancing Kubernetes with Tetrate

Tetrate provides tools for seamlessly implementing security, identity, [traffic management, and other policies across Kubernetes](/manage-kubernetes-complexity/) clusters. The tools address the unique challenges containers and Kubernetes bring regarding complexity, security, and consistency.

Organizations cannot approach security in Kubernetes with a one-size-fits-all mentality. Instead, it requires a comprehensive strategy tailored to each environment’s specific needs and architecture. By following the best practices mentioned above, in conjunction with management solutions such as Tetrate’s Istio Service Mesh and other Kubernetes tools, organizations can build solid and secure Kubernetes ecosystems capable of supporting their most critical applications without any additional management overhead.
