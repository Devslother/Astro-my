Kubernetes has a security architecture based on the principle of defense in depth. This means that it incorporates multiple layers of security controls throughout the platform to deliver robust security. The security controls needed include the items mentioned in the previous section. At the architectural level, the flooring items also need to be protected with suitable security techniques:

## [](#secure-storage)Secure Storage

The security of the Etcd storage backend, where all cluster data is stored, requires top-tier hardware and software protection.

## [](#use-a-service-mesh)Use a Service Mesh

A service mesh adds a layer of security across the Kubernetes platform deployment by adding features like traffic encryption and monitoring to enhance the underlying network security.

## [](#use-namespaces)Use Namespaces

Dividing Kubernetes clusters into logical segments using namespaces improves resource isolation and limits the impact of any breaches to a subset of the deployed resources. This is part of the broader segmentation recommended for Kubernetes deployments.
