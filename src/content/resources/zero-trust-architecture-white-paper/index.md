Zero trust security is getting a lot of attention—and for good reason. It’s a paradigm shift in security architectures that addresses significant problems with protecting the highly dynamic, distributed systems driving today’s cloud-native applications.

But, zero trust is more than just authentication and encryption on the wire. In this white paper, Zack Butcher—Tetrate founding engineer and co-author of [NIST SP 800-204a, “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture”](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/204/a/final)— offers an overview of Zero Trust for microservices applications and why a service mesh is the best way to implement it.
