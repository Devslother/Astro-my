The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) establishes stringent requirements to protect cardholder data and ensure the integrity of payment systems. As businesses increasingly adopt cloud-native, distributed architectures, meeting [PCI](/blog/istio-for-pci-compliance-implementing-pci-dss-4-0-1-with-service-mesh-security/) DSS compliance becomes more complex, particularly in managing the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) across hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures.

Modern architectures demand innovative solutions to address these challenges while maintaining robust security and operational efficiency. This is where Tetrate’s enterprise-grade gateway and service mesh solutions—Tetrate Istio Subscription (TIS), Tetrate Enterprise Gateway (TEG), and Tetrate Service Bridge (TSB)—come into play. These products provide a unified platform for securing, managing, and observing application traffic, enabling organizations to implement PCI DSS requirements with precision and ease.

Tetrate’s products empower businesses to achieve network segmentation, end-to-end encryption, fine-grained access control, and real-time observability—all essential components of PCI DSS compliance. By integrating seamlessly into existing infrastructure, Tetrate solutions reduce the scope of compliance efforts while enhancing the overall security posture of payment environments.

This white paper explores how Tetrate’s solutions align with and support key PCI DSS requirements. It demonstrates how these tools simplify compliance, reduce operational complexity, and provide the flexibility to scale securely across modern, distributed systems. Whether you’re securing a legacy environment, transitioning to the cloud, or managing a hybrid infrastructure, Tetrate enables you to meet the highest security standards while delivering consistent, compliant payment services.
