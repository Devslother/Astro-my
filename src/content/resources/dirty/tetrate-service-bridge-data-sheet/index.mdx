Tetrate Service Bridge unifies and simplifies the connectivity, security, observability and reliability for your entire application fleet—across Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, bare metal servers and across clouds and on-premises deployments.  
TSB is also a “bridge” between your organization—its people, teams, and applications—and your compute infrastructure, making it easy to assign consistent policies and access rights so your teams can safely control application resources.
