Envoy Gateway supports the new Gateway API, as a replacement for the older Kubernetes Ingress API. In this episode of TFiR: Let’s Talk recorded at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe, Zack Butcher, Founding and Principal Engineer at Tetrate, discusses the company’s involvement in the project, the features and improvements in the Envoy Gateway 1.0 release, and their focus for the future.
