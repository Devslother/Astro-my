Were you there? Were you not? Don’t worry! You can catch up with the sessions by [watching the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUQORQEatnJezysGP4J-EZm34u-OyILC2). The conference organizers have now made available the recordings for all the sessions.

Did you know that [our very own Edo was there?](/blog/tetrate-at-jfokus24-webassembly-from-the-inside-out/) If you want to learn more about WebAssembly and how a Wasm runtime is implemented, we invite you to take a look at Edoardo’s deep dive on the internals of the [**wazero runtime**](https://wazero.io/)**,** one of the [open source projects that Tetrate is proud to sponsor](/open-source-contributions/).

[**WebAssembly from the Inside out**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=schP6q1B3xM) explains how Wasm compares to other bytecode VMs such as the JVM, and explains how a WebAssembly runtime is implemented, explaining how the [**wazero pure-Go runtime**](https://wazero.io/) works. Edoardo also gives an overview of how Wasm can be useful for use cases beyond the browser (such as, of course, [extending Envoy](/blog/validating-a-request-payload-with-wasm/)) and he points out related WebAssembly runtimes for Java developers. Don’t miss it and [**watch it on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=schP6q1B3xM) or below. You can find [Edoardo on X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/evacchi) and on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@evacchi). And of course, you can always find the **wazero** development team in the [#wazero channel of the Gophers Slack.](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/)
