Today marks an exciting milestone for enterprises eager to integrate Generative AI (GenAI) into their applications at scale. With the first release of Envoy [AI](https://tetrate.io/learn/ai) Gateway, Tetrate and Bloomberg are pioneering a standardized and scalable approach to AI service integration in the Envoy Open Source community.

This release is the opening chapter of the journey. At Tetrate, we envision it as a foundation for organizations to embrace GenAI while ensuring control, enhancing security, and optimizing cost efficiency.

## [](#the-challenge-ai-at-scale-needs-a-new-approach)The Challenge: AI at Scale Needs a New Approach

Every enterprise looking to integrate GenAI faces similar hurdles:

*   Managing multiple GenAI service providers
*   Controlling costs with granular rate limits
*   Ensuring security and compliance across GenAI integrations

Many early GenAI adopters have resorted to Python-based gateways. However the nature of Python and it’s global interpreter lock makes it difficult to handle many concurrent connections.

Envoy AI Gateway changes that with its foundation in Envoy Proxy, the modern cloud-native proxy designed for efficient concurrent request handling, and Envoy Gateway for scalable Kubernetes-based deployment.

Built on **Envoy Gateway**, Envoy AI Gateway provides a **unified layer** for easily integrating multiple LLM providers.

The **0.1 release** introduces:

*   **Unified LLM API:** A single API interface for integrating with AWS Bedrock and OpenAI, with more providers coming soon.
*   **Upstream Authorization:** Streamlined authentication management for different LLM services.
*   **Usage-Based Rate Limiting:** Fine-grained control over token-based usage is needed to manage LLM usage costs efficiently.

This release is not the finish line; it’s the first step toward a standardized, scalable enterprise AI integration layer.

At Tetrate, we are focused on helping enterprises manage complex, distributed architectures, from microservices to Kubernetes networking to service mesh security.

As organizations adopt GenAI for product features, automation, and knowledge retrieval, the need for enterprise-ready infrastructure is pressing. Envoy AI Gateway provides that foundation.

Bloomberg is already leveraging it to centralize GenAI integration, ensuring **consistent access control, usage quotas, and provider-agnostic integration**. This approach streamlines AI adoption across the organization while enabling governance at scale.

## [](#whats-next-expanding-enterprise-ai-enablement)What’s Next? Expanding Enterprise AI Enablement

The **0.1 release** is just the start for Envoy AI Gateway. The roadmap ahead includes:

*   **Google Gemini 2.0 integration** to expand multi-provider capabilities.
*   **Provider and model fallback logic** to ensure high availability.
*   **Prompt templating and semantic caching** to optimize AI cost and performance.

## [](#enabling-enterprises-beyond-envoy-ai-gateway)Enabling Enterprises Beyond Envoy AI Gateway

Tetrate is committed to building **enterprise-ready solutions on Envoy,** and AI is no exception. As this project evolves, **we will continue building capabilities to help organizations maximize their AI investments.**
