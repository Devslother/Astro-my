**September 29, 2020 —** The **Envoy Product Security Team (PST)** announced  the availability of a security fix and a series of patches for Envoy versions 1.12,1.13, 1.14 and 1.15 to address two **high-risk** vulnerabilities related to header values and HTTP URL paths. In response to CVE-2020-25017. Additionally the **Istio community** recommends users to upgrade to 1.6.11+ for 1.6.x deployments or 1.7.3 or later for 1.7.x deployments.

Users are encouraged to apply the related patches to address the following CVEs:

*   **CVE-2020-25017** (CVSS score 8.3, High) Envoy through 1.15.0 only considers the first value when multiple header values are present for some HTTP headers. Also, Envoy’s setCopy() header map API does not replace all existing occurrences of a non-inline header. See the [Envoy GitHub advisory](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-2v25-cjjq-5f4w) and [Istio advisory](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2020-006/) for more details.
*   **CVE-2020-25018** ([CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) score 7.5, High) Envoy master after 2d69e30 may fail to parse request URL that requires host canonicalization. The use of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) as the host component in a request URL triggers the URL parser library used by Envoy to do Punycode encoding (to convert Unicode characters to ASCII). Since the conversion data is not available, it fails the conversion, which could result in executing code in faulting address (segmentation fault). See the [GitHub advisory](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-fwwh-fc9w-9673) for more details.

## [](#am-i-at-risk)**Am I at Risk?**

Envoy versions 1.15 or earlier deployments are vulnerable to CVE-2020-25017. Run \`envoy –version\` and if it indicates a base version of 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.4, 1.12.6 or older you are running a vulnerable version.

For Istio users – the affected versions are:

*   1.6 to 1.6.10
*   1.7 to 1.7.2

## [](#how-do-i-fix-it)**How do I fix it?**

The Envoy security team has announced the availability of Envoy versions **1.15.1**, **1.14.5**, **1.13.6**, and **1.12.7** to address the incorrect handling of duplicate HTTP headers (CVE-2020-25017). Users are encouraged to upgrade to these versions to fix the issue.

Including the [3b5acb2](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/3b5acb2f43548862dadb243de7cf3994986a8e04) commit, pushed into the main branch on Sept. 29, 2020 at 12 PDT, is encouraged to fix CVE-2020-25017. The vulnerability is not included in any Envoy releases and will not affect end-users who deployed the official Envoy release.

Istio users should upgrade to 1.6.11+ for 1.6.x deployments or 1.7.3 or later for 1.7.x deployments.

If you’re a Tetrate Service Bridge customer, please review this issue with your Tetrate support contact if any changes in your environment are required.
