Staying ahead of common vulnerabilities and exposures ([CVEs](/faq/what-are-the-benefits-of-cves/)) in your infrastructure is a critical part of application security—but finding them isn’t always easy. That’s why we built the free new [Tetrate Vulnerability Scanner (TVS)](https://docs.tetrate.io/istio-subscription/tools/tvs/) for Istio. [This free download](https://docs.tetrate.io/istio-subscription/tools/tvs/download) finds and reports the CVE status of all your Istio deployments in minutes and alerts you as new vulnerabilities are discovered to make sure you’re always up to date on the latest threats.

## [](#why-tvs)Why TVS?

In an increasingly complex digital landscape, traditional CVE scanning tools often fall short in addressing the specific needs of network-facing services like Istio and Envoy. TVS fills this critical gap by offering targeted detection of CVEs, ensuring that your cloud environments are not just secure, but also resilient against the ever-evolving cyber threats.

1.  [Download the TVS CLI ›](https://docs.tetrate.io/istio-subscription/tools/tvs/download)
2.  Run tvs register to get access token
3.  Run  tvs scan to start scanning your Kubernetes clusters.
4.  When it’s done scanning, TVS will provide you a detailed report on the CVE status of every Istio container in your deployment (see example below): 

Image could not be loaded

Image could not be loaded in lightbox

document.addEventListener("click", (e) => { const trigger = e.target.closest("\[data-lightbox-trigger\]"); const close = e.target.closest("\[data-lightbox-close\]"); if (trigger) { e.preventDefault(); const figure = trigger.closest("figure"); const lightbox = figure?.querySelector("\[data-lightbox\]"); if (lightbox) { lightbox.classList.remove("lightbox--closing"); lightbox.classList.add("active"); document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"; } } if (close) { e.preventDefault(); const lightbox = e.target.closest("\[data-lightbox\]"); if (lightbox) { lightbox.classList.add("lightbox--closing"); lightbox.classList.remove("active"); document.body.style.overflow = ""; setTimeout(() => { lightbox.classList.remove("lightbox--closing"); }, 300); } } }); // Close lightbox on ESC key document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => { if (e.key === "Escape") { const activeLightbox = document.querySelector(".lightbox.active"); if (activeLightbox) { activeLightbox.classList.add("lightbox--closing"); activeLightbox.classList.remove("active"); document.body.style.overflow = ""; setTimeout(() => { activeLightbox.classList.remove("lightbox--closing"); }, 300); } } });

\## What Sets TVS Apart?

**Specialized Focus on Istio and Envoy:** TVS goes beyond generic container-level vulnerability scanning. By focusing specifically on Istio and Envoy, it provides a more relevant and precise security assessment for these critical components of your network infrastructure.

**Automation and Efficiency:** Keeping up with the latest security notices and updates can be a daunting task. TVS automates this process, effectively reducing the manual effort required to stay informed about the latest vulnerabilities.

**Privacy and Security:** At Tetrate, we understand the importance of privacy. TVS  is designed with this in mind, ensuring that while it logs SHA digests for image identification and CVE detection, it does not associate these with any personal data, including IP addresses.

## [](#future-proofing-your-security)Future-Proofing Your Security

While TVS currently supports Istio, we are committed to evolving alongside the needs of our users. We’re already working to extend TVS  to protect additional products and services, ensuring that it remains an indispensable tool in your security arsenal.
