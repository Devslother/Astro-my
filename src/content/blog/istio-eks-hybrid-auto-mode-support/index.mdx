TIS+ empowers platform operators and application teams with the visibility needed to ensure optimal performance, rapid troubleshooting, and informed decision-making across their Istio-enabled environments.

## [](#validated-istio-support-for-amazon-eks-hybrid-and-auto-modes)Validated Istio Support for Amazon EKS Hybrid and Auto Modes

Tetrate and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have a long-standing partnership focused on making Istio accessible, reliable, and scalable for AWS customers. Tetrate was a [launch partner with Amazon for EKS Anywhere](/blog/tetrate-eks-anywhere/), working with Amazon to ensure seamless integration with EKS and EKS Anywhere. And, most recently, we are proud to announce our continued collaboration with AWS to [validate support for Istio on the newly launched Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes and Auto Mode features](/blog/tetrate-partners-with-aws-to-validate-istio-support-for-amazon-eks-hybrid-and-auto-modes/). This partnership offers:

*   **Seamless Integration:** Tetrate’s Istio distribution integrates effortlessly with EKS Hybrid Nodes, enabling consistent service mesh functionality across hybrid environments, including on-premises and edge infrastructures.
*   **Simplified Operations with EKS Auto Mode:** EKS Auto Mode automates the management of compute, storage, and networking for Kubernetes clusters. Tetrate’s Istio solutions have been rigorously tested to ensure compatibility and performance, allowing customers to benefit from simplified Kubernetes operations without compromising on service mesh capabilities.
*   **Enhanced Flexibility and Cost Optimization:** Deploy Istio-based service meshes consistently across diverse infrastructure environments, leveraging AWS’s intelligent resource allocation to minimize compute costs and improve security.

## [](#what-customers-are-saying)What Customers Are Saying

In our conversations with Istio users, we’re seeing consistent themes driving TIS and TIS+ adoption, including:

**Solving Practical Istio Issues**

We see customers seeking practical, dependable solutions to streamline their operations, such as prioritized Istio fixes for TIS customers ahead of upstream releases and tools like [Tetrate Config Analyzer](/blog/introducing-tetrate-config-analyzer-tca/) to identify configuration issues before deployment. These solutions help enhance reliability, reduce downtime, and ensure smoother day-to-day management of Istio environments.

**Providing Enhanced Istio Visibility & Troubleshooting to Supplement Existing Tools**

Users are also looking to complement their existing monitoring solutions with advanced visibility and troubleshooting tools uniquely suited to application traffic managed by Istio. TIS+ delivers these capabilities directly at their fingertips, enabling deeper insights and faster resolution of issues within their service mesh.

**Facilitating Multi-Cluster Deployments**

We’re also seeing increasing adoption of multi-cluster Istio deployments to enhance scalability and resilience. As these environments grow, users are looking for robust solutions to simplify monitoring and troubleshooting cross-cluster communication, ensuring seamless service interactions and minimizing operational complexities.

## [](#whats-next)What’s Next

These advancements underscore Tetrate’s commitment to providing cutting-edge service mesh solutions that integrate seamlessly with the latest cloud technologies, empowering enterprises to streamline their Kubernetes operations and accelerate their cloud-native journeys.
